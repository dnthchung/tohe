      "text": "In Vietnamese culture, the 12 zodiac animals are more than markers of time — they represent deep beliefs, character traits, and the harmony between humans and nature. Each animal carries its own symbolism, reflecting values such as courage, intelligence, loyalty, and perseverance. As a result, the zodiac is deeply woven into Vietnamese spiritual life, folk arts, and cultural identity."

    "passage2": {
      "text": "This tò he collection inspired by the 12 zodiac signs brings together two traditional heritages in one creative expression. Made from colorful hand-molded rice powder, each tò he figure offers a playful yet meaningful interpretation of these familiar symbols. More than handcrafted toys, these figures act as cultural storytellers — preserving and sharing the beauty of Vietnamese traditions in a fresh, engaging way, especially for younger generations."
